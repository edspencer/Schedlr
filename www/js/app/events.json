'Frozen Music' is the title of the event that kicks off this year\u2019s Ars Electronica Festival and also marks the official reopening of Linz\u2019s Tabakfabrik. This venue, a former tobacco processing plant that\u2019s been closed since September 2009, is one of Austria\u2019s most significant industrial landmarks. Artistic interventions, performances and sound and light shows staged in the facility\u2019s inner courtyard will throw open imaginary doors and windows, and transport audience members deeper and deeper inside\u2014into a world in which productivity is seemingly paralyzed but can still be perceived with all the senses.",
